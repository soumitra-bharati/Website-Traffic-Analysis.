# Website Traffic and User Behavior Analysis
üöÄ ** Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a website traffic dataset to identify user behavior patterns, measure key performance indicators (KPIs), and derive actionable insights for marketing and website optimization. The entire data lifecycle is covered, from cleaning and preparation in a MySQL database to final visualization in a summary dashboard.




The analysis focuses on answering critical business questions such as:

Which traffic sources drive the most sessions and conversions?

How does user behavior differ across various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet)?

What are the peak hours for user activity on the website?

How effective is the website at retaining users over time?

üìä ** Dashboard Preview
The final output is a comprehensive dashboard that visually summarizes the key findings from the analysis.

** Database: MySQL 
** Data Cleaning & Analysis: SQL 

Data Generation: Python

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau

üìà Project Workflow

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The raw dataset was loaded into a MySQL database named web_traffic_db. Data quality was ensured by handling missing values and removing outliers, such as capping 

session_duration_seconds at 3600. A clean, stable 

cleaned_traffic view was created for all subsequent analysis.

KPI Calculation: Key metrics were calculated using targeted SQL queries. This included:


Bounce Rate: Calculated as the sum of bounced sessions divided by the total number of sessions.


Conversion Rate: The percentage of sessions that result in a conversion, grouped by traffic source.


Average Session Duration: The average time users spend on the site.


Retention Rate: A cohort analysis was performed using advanced SQL (CTEs) to find the percentage of users who returned for a second session on a different day.


Data Analysis & Visualization: The aggregated data was used to build the final dashboard, visualizing trends in traffic, conversions, and user engagement over time.



üí° Key Insights & Results

Top Performing Channel: Organic Search is the most valuable traffic source, driving the highest number of sessions (8.0K) and the most conversions (409, or 41.35% of the total).






Device Performance: Desktop users are the highest converting segment, accounting for 491 conversions.





Peak Engagement Hours: User traffic peaks around 11:00 AM, with 885 sessions recorded at that hour, providing an optimal time for marketing activities.





User Retention: The analysis revealed a user retention rate of 92.47%.




Traffic Quality: The overall bounce rate for the website is 40.40%, with consistent performance across all major traffic sources (39-41%).
